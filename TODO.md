# TODO for Enhancing Floating Navigation Panel

- [x] Update floating-nav.html: Add Enter/Proceed button and optional toggle switches (Notifications, Emergency Alert) with icons and text labels.
- [x] Update floating-nav.css: Style buttons as rounded pill switches, add hover/scale effects, smooth transitions, and ensure responsiveness.
- [x] Update floating-nav.js: Add event handlers for new buttons (Enter/Proceed navigates forward or confirms, toggles for quick actions).
- [ ] Thorough testing: Test panel on all dashboard pages, responsiveness, navigation, toggle functionality, accessibility, cross-browser.
